# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.
        Allows you to combine the circuits.
### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.
        The constraint file allows the connection between the FPGA and Vivado, essentially it connects the hardware to the software.
### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?
